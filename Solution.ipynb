    "#### Distributted Throttle\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "- Assume there is a pool of task workers running a large set of tasks concurrently.\n",
    "- Some of the tasks require work to be done that has some \"natural limit\" that spans across all workers. For example, some tasks may use a shared key to hit an external API which enforces a rate limit\n",
    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "- Create a python decorator that can wrap a function and prevent multiple worker processes from running that function more then once per x seconds (across all workers)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- Throttled (limitted) calls can return None\n",
    "- Redis is available\n",
    "- No specific task queue system is required. You can simulated a task queue by running multiple worker processes that each call the throttled functions at random intervals.\n"

    "#### Solution Design and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main Goal**:\n",
    "Based on my understanding of the task, I needed to limit execution of a function across the threads to once per time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Design Background**:\n",
    "- The decorator should acquire a lock in a non-blocking manner and set a timeout before releasing it. The timeout mimicks the API reset interval. The non-blocking approach is important to avoid holding resources that could be used for other tasks. \n",
    "- Test with BoundedSemaphore, as it provides the ValueError exception that occurs if release() calls try to increment the BoundedSemaphore counter beyond itâ€™s assigned maximum value. This will allow for the None to be returned for the throttled calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Approach**:\n",
    "1. main() - Spins up a pool of threads across random intervals to simulate a queue\n",
    "2. retrieve_data() - the function to be throttled - will mimick an API response with a timer\n",
    "3. @throttler() - decorator that should take in a function to limit across threads and a timeout interval to mimick API reset intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results/Logs Overview**:\n",
    "- \"Started API Request\" - logs that the API **request** is triggered inside the throttled function (retrieve_data)\n",
    "- \"Shared key is not freed...\" - logs for threads that tried to release() before BoundedSemaphore allowance was met\n",
    "- \"Finished API Request\" - logs that the API **response** was recieved in retrieve_data()\n",
    "- The API reset (timeout) was set to 3 seconds\n",
    "- Below log shows that, for example:\n",
    "  - Thread-8 started the throttled function execution\n",
    "  - Thread-9 tried to release before Thread-8 (8 acquired first), but got kicked out due to semaphore limit\n",
    "  - Thread-10 started the throttled function execution after Thread-8 waited for the timeout period and released\n",
    "  - Thread-8 meanwhile got the response back from a slow API...\n",
    "  ...\n",
